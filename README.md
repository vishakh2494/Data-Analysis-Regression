# Data-Analysis-Regression

The weather data for Szeged, Hungary was collected by using DarkSky.Net API which makes use of various weather-related sensors to read the values of various influential variables such as humidity, air pressure, wind speed and direction, visibility and cloud cover. The data is recorded on an hourly basis everyday throughout the year.
This data was then portioned among the team members based on months (quarterly). Each member then divided their respective dataset into two parts based on the 80:20 split ratio in which the larger portion was the training set and the remaining part was considered as test set. Then later everyone performed regression analysis on their respective quarters and came up with two unique models and then tested those models on the test set. 
The outcomes and observations of this analysis can be used by the citizens to improve their understanding of local weather. These outcomes can further be used by the tourists and tourism department of Hungary for better tourist experience.
